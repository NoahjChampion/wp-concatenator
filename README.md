WP-Concatenator
=================

Overview
--------

WP-Concatenator is a WordPress plugin to perform CSS and Javascript concatenation of individual script files into one resource request.
This plugin is based on [automattic's](https://automattic.com/) plugin called [nginx-http-concat](https://github.com/Automattic/nginx-http-concat). But unlike that plugin, it doesn't require server configuration and is a drop-in solution. 

This plugin is still under development.
